Sliceable switch
================

**!!!! NOTICE !!!!**
**THIS APPLICATION IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND MAY NOT WORK EXPECTEDLY.**

What's this?
------------

This is a layer 2 switch application with slicing and packet filter
function. The slicing function allows us to create multiple layer 2
domains (similar to port and MAC-based VLAN but there is no limitation
on VLAN ID space). The filter function implements an access control
list.

How to build
------------

  Build Trema

        $ git clone git://github.com/trema/trema.git trema
        $ git clone git://github.com/trema/apps.git apps
        $ cd trema
        $ ./build.rb

  Build Topology and Flow manager

        $ cd ../apps/topology
        $ make
        $ cd ../flow_manager
        $ make

  Build sliceable switch and setup databases

        $ cd ../sliceable_switch
        $ make
        $ sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libdbi-perl libdbd-sqlite3-perl
        $ ./create_tables.sh

How to configure
----------------

        Add packet filter definitions
        (See 'filter' command for details)

        Add slice definitions
        (See 'slice' command for details)

How to run
----------

        $ cd ../../trema
        $ sudo ./trema run -c ../apps/sliceable_switch/sliceable_switch.conf

How to enable REST-based configuration interface
------------------------------------------------

This application has a REST-based interface for configuring slice
and packet filter definitions from external application. The following
instruction shows how to configure the interface.

Note that the following instruction is only valid for Ubuntu Linux
or Debian GNU/Linux.

  Install required software packages

        $ sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork libjson-perl

  Create configuration database (if you have not created yet)

        $ ./create_tables.sh

  Configure Apache web server

        $ sudo cp apache/sliceable_switch /etc/apache2/sites-available
        $ sudo a2enmod rewrite actions
        $ sudo a2ensite sliceable_switch
        $ sudo mkdir -p /home/sliceable_switch/script
        $ sudo mkdir /home/sliceable_switch/db
        $ sudo cp Slice.pm Filter.pm config.cgi /home/sliceable_switch/script
        $ sudo cp *.db /home/sliceable_switch/db
        $ sudo chown -R www-data.www-data /home/sliceable_switch
        $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
