Feature: control multiple openflow switchies using sliceable_switch

  As a Trema user
  I want to control multiple openflow switches using sliceable_switch application
  So that I can send and receive packets


  Scenario: One openflow switch, 65535 slices, six servers, mac binding
    Given the slice table from script "../apps/sliceable_switch/test/65535_slices.pl"
    And the following filter records
      | filter_id | rule_specification      |
      | default   | priority=0 action=ALLOW |
    When I try trema run "../apps/sliceable_switch/sliceable_switch -s tmp/slice.db -f tmp/filter.db" with following configuration (backgrounded):
      """
      vswitch("sliceable_switch1") { datapath_id "0x1" }

      vhost("host1") { mac "00:00:00:00:00:01" }
      vhost("host2") { mac "00:00:00:00:00:02" }
      vhost("host65535") { mac "00:00:00:00:ff:ff" }
      vhost("host65536") { mac "00:00:00:01:00:00" }
      vhost("host131069") { mac "00:00:00:01:ff:fd" }
      vhost("host131070") { mac "00:00:00:01:ff:fe" }

      link "sliceable_switch1", "host1"
      link "sliceable_switch1", "host2"
      link "sliceable_switch1", "host65535"
      link "sliceable_switch1", "host65536"
      link "sliceable_switch1", "host131069"
      link "sliceable_switch1", "host131070"

      run { path "../apps/topology/topology" }
      run { path "../apps/topology/topology_discovery" }
      run { path "../apps/flow_manager/flow_manager" }

      event :port_status => "topology", :packet_in => "filter", :state_notify => "topology"
      filter :lldp => "topology_discovery", :packet_in => "sliceable_switch"
      """
      And wait until "sliceable_switch" is up
