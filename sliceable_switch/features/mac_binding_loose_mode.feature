Feature: control multiple openflow switchies using sliceable_switch

  As a Trema user
  I want to control multiple openflow switches using sliceable_switch application
  So that I can send and receive packets


  Scenario: One openflow switch, two slices, four servers, mac binding ( loose mode )
    Given the following slice records
      | slice_id | description |
      | test1    | slice1      |
      | test2    | slice2      |
    And the following mac binding records
      | slice_id | address           | binding_id |
      | test1    | 00:00:00:00:00:01 | host1      |
      | test1    | 00:00:00:00:00:02 | host2      |
      | test2    | 00:00:00:00:00:03 | host3      |
    And the following filter records
      | filter_id | rule_specification      |
      | default   | priority=0 action=ALLOW |
    When I try trema run "../apps/sliceable_switch/sliceable_switch -s tmp/slice.db -f tmp/filter.db --loose" with following configuration (backgrounded):
