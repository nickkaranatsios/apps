Feature: control multiple openflow switchies using sliceable_switch

  As a Trema user
  I want to control multiple openflow switches using sliceable_switch application
  So that I can send and receive packets


  Scenario: One openflow switch, two slices, four servers, port and mac binding
    Given the following slice records
      | slice_id | description |
      | test1    | slice1      |
      | test2    | slice2      |
    And the following port binding records
      | slice_id | dpid  | port | vid    | binding_id |
      | test1    | 0x1   | 3    | 0xffff | host1      |
      | test1    | 0x1   | 1    | 0xffff | host2      |
      | test2    | 0x1   | 2    | 0xffff | host3      |
    And the following port and mac binding records
      | slice_id | port_binding_id | address           | binding_id |
      | test1    | host1           | 00:00:00:00:00:01 | host1_mac  |
