Flow Dumper Application
=======================

* What's this?

This application retrieves flow entries from all switches connected and
outputs flow entries in text form on console terminal.

* How to build

  Build Trema and flow dumper
  $ git clone git://github.com/trema/trema.git trema
  $ git clone git://github.com/trema/apps.git apps
  $ cd trema
  $ ./build.rb
  $ cd ../apps/flow_dumper
  $ make
  $ cd ../../trema

* How to run

  Run a controller application developed on top of Trema which installs
  flow entries. For example:
  $ ./trema run -c ./src/examples/learning_switch/learning_switch.conf \
  ./objects/examples/learning_switch/learning_switch -d

  Run flow dumper
  $ TREMA_HOME=`pwd` ../apps/flow_dumper/flow_dumper

  If you have any flow entries, you can see output like follows:
  $ TREMA_HOME=`pwd` ../apps/flow_dumper/flow_dumper
  [0x00000000000abc] priority = 65535, match = [wildcards = 0, in_port = 1,
  dl_src = 00:00:00:01:00:02, dl_dst = 00:00:00:01:00:01, dl_vlan = 65535,
  dl_vlan_pcp = 0, dl_type = 0x800, nw_tos = 0, nw_proto = 17,
  nw_src = 192.168.0.2, nw_dst = 192.168.0.1, tp_src = 1, tp_dst = 1],
  actions = [output: port=2 max_len=65535]
