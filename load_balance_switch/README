Load Balance Switch Application
===============================

This application is created for the tutorial session at Tokyo Institute of
Technology. It is intended for persons who want to understand how to
implement IPC among moudles developed on top of Trema. Thus, it does not
provide full load balance functionality and definitely does not work in
real network environment.
